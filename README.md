Simple pygame program simulating the planets Earth, Mars, Mercury and Venus orbitting the Sun.
Gravity of planets does affect each other -> don't think this actually works so changed to just effect of Sun
Tried adding in the moon -> some scale problems (appears almost same place as Earth on this scale) and did not work.. so removed.

The solarsystem.png show a typical screen shot.  The code does not generate screenshots or animated movies.
