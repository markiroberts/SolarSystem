Simple pygame program simulating the planets Earth, Mars, Mercury and Venus orbitting the Sun.
Gravity of planets does affect each other -> don't think this actually works so changed to just effect of Sun
Tried adding in the moon -> some scale problems (appears almost same place as Earth on this scale) and did not work.. so removed.

The solarsystem.gif just shows what it looks like as an animated .gif.  The code does not generate a .gif or .mp4.
